This is a simple Java program that manages books and users in a library. I built it step by step to keep it clear and easy to maintain.
First, I planned the main features: adding users, adding books, viewing all records, and managing the library system through a menu.
I created separate classes for each part so the code stays clean and reusable. One class handles user details, another handles book details, and another connects everything together with operations and a menu system.
The whole program runs in a loop, so you can perform multiple actions until you decide to exit.

How to Run:
1. Save all the project files (users.java, book.java, library.java, and any additional files) in the same folder.
2.Open a terminal/command prompt in that folder.
3.Compile the code:
  javac *.java
4.Run the program:
  java library

Features:
1-Add and manage users
2-Add and manage books
3-Show all users and books in the system
4-Menu-driven interface for easy navigation
5-Perform multiple operations in one session
